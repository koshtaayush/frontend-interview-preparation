## Before you start coding! Think hard -
- What type of data you having? Is it array or what? Is it sorted?
- What is required to solve this?
  - Array|Stack|DP|Recursion
- Think whether you can apply any algo like binary search if data is an array and sorted?

## Naming Conventions
- `FLAG_problemDesc_algoUsed/TrickDesc`

## Flag
- `TR` Tricky way of solving
