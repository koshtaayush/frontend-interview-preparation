# Interview Preparation Guidelines & Sources
This is my own journey describing how I started preparing for good companies. Initially, I was confused regarding how and what to start actually! So, thought to make this guide which could help me in future too and may also help you? :) <br>
If you're reading and using these guidelines, please feel free to approach me if you want to add anything to it.

`Note:` Whatever is written is written as per my understanding's and observation's during preparation. 

## How to start?
1. Start from the basics. Brush up your `JS` well enough.
2. Cover up Data Structures main topics like sorting, searching, binary tree algorithms only for a now.
3. Now we know `JS` and `DS` both. Time to apply these now. Start solving coding questions. Choose any of the online coding platform. One which I like is [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) 
    1. Solve problems from easy then increase your level. 
    2. While solving problems, also look at solutions submitted by other users. You'll observe how optimised code others have written.
    3. Keep doing this and increase your level.
4. Get hand's on over concepts like - 
    1. IIFE
    2. Closures
    3. Currying
5. Understand `Dynamic Programming` properly. Why DP over greedy? Why DP over recursion?
6. Try to create Ployfills on your own. Pick any function from lodash or ramda and try creating your's.

## Before you start coding! Think hard, ask yourself -
- What type of data you having? Is it array or what? Is it sorted?
- What is required to solve this?
  - Array|Stack|DP|Recursion
- Think whether you can apply any algo like binary search if data is an array and sorted?

## Naming Conventions
- `FLAG_problemDesc_algoUsed/TrickDesc`

## Flag
- `TR` Tricky way of solving
- `DP` Dynamic Programming
