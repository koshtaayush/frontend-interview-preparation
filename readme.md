# Interview Preparation Guidelines & Sources
This is my journey - how I started preparing for interviews. Initially, it seems confusing how and what to start actually! So, thought to make this guide which could help me in future too and may also help you? :) <br>
If you're reading and would like to add something to it, please feel free to do so. :) 

`Note:` Whatever is written is written as per my understanding's and observation's during preparation. 

## How to start?
1. Start from the basics. Brush up your `JS` well enough.
2. Cover up Data Structures main topics like sorting, searching, binary tree algorithms only for a now.
3. Now we know `JS` and `DS` both. Time to apply these now. Start solving coding questions. Choose any of the online coding platform. One which I like is [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) 
    1. Solve problems from easy then increase your level. 
    2. While solving problems, also look at solutions submitted by other users. You'll observe how optimised code others have written.
    3. Keep doing this and increase your level.
4. Get hand's on over concepts like - 
    1. IIFE
    2. Closures
    3. Currying
5. Understand `Dynamic Programming` properly. Why DP over greedy? Why DP over recursion?
6. Try to create Ployfills on your own. Pick any function from lodash or [ramda](https://ramdajs.com) and try creating your's.

## Before you start coding! Think hard, ask yourself -
- Follow `PEDAC` - understand the `P`roblem `E`xample `D`atastructure `A`lgorithm `C`ode.
- Problem - Divide into parts
    - Process the problem [PEDA]
    - Code [C]
- PEDAC Guide
    1. Understand Problem
        - Expected i/p and o/p
        - discuss requirements clearly. Leave no room for confusion
    2. Example
        - Understand problem with example, validate it once again
    3. Data Structure
        - Which DS you will use - Array, Tree, List, Stack
        - Which concept you can use to solve - Binary search, merge sort, DP, recursion, etc, [read more here]()
    4. Algorithm
        - English level understandable algo
    5. Code with Intent
        - Implementation of algorithm

## Naming Conventions
- `FLAG_problemDesc_algoUsed/TrickDesc`

## Flag
- `TR` Tricky way of solving
- `DP` Dynamic Programming
