# Concepts, Algos, Techniques 
This contains tips to tackle different types of problems and to identify which technique to use when.
## Binary Search
Use this when you have sorted array or linklist or matrix.

## Dynamic Programming
Problems like Min, max, shortest, longest, total no of ways. These kind of problems requires optimisation. Can be solved using greedy and DP. Greedy fails sometimes so DP is used. With optimization problems, you see terms like shortest/longest, minimized/maximized, least/most, fewest/greatest, biggest/smallest, etc.<br/>
DP is applicable to the problems which are having properties of -
- overlapping sub problem
    - in which solutions of subproblem help in finding big solution. You dont have to re-compute because we have already stored result of small sub probs.
- optimal sub structure
    - Solution can be obtained by finding optimal solution of itâ€™s sub-problem<br/>

## Sliding Window
- Very well suited for iteratable items like array, strings, linklist
- when you see Q such as longest, shortest, min, max, subarray, contains, etc.
- need to find from contiguous sequence<br/>
